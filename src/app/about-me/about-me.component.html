        I am currently working as a Software Developer at Vendasta Technologies in Saskatoon, SK. I specialize in
        frontend web development, using primarily Angular, RxJs, SCSS. I also do some development using GoLang, Python,
        Google Cloud Platform, and more.

        I have a degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Saskatchewan, and have worked in various engineering
        roles before my transition to software. I am presently finishing up an additional degree in Computer Science on the
        side while working, with an expected completion date of Spring 2021.
